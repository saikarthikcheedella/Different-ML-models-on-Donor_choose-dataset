# Different-ML-models-on-Donor_choose-dataset

This repo contains EDA.pynb on dataset, and implementation of various ML models on this "Donor choose".
1. KNN
2. Naive Bayes
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machines (SVM's)
5. Decision Trees
6. Random Forest
7. Gradient Boosting Decision Trees(GBDT's)


In every model, few steps are common:
  1) Data pre-processing.
  2) Vectorizing data using different word-embeddings (Tfidf, Word2Vec,..).
  3) Hyper-parameter tuning.
  4) Running model with best params.
  5) Evaluate Performance metrics (ROC_AUC, F1_score, Accuracy,..).
  6) Conclusion.
